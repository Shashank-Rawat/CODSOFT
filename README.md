# CODSOFT INTERNSHIP PROGRAM : 
This is a repository to showcase the tasks given in Codsoft internship program.

### Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict Titanic passenger survival using machine learning models.
- **Dataset**: Includes features such as age, gender, class, and fare.
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, SVM.
- **Evaluation**: Compared model performance to select the best predictor.

### Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction using Python
- **Objective**: Predict movie ratings using machine learning models based on features like genre, director, and actors.
- **Dataset**: Includes features such as genre, director, actors, and other relevant movie attributes, with ratings as the target variable.
- **Models Used**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boost.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score to determine the most accurate predictor of movie ratings.
